        <p>Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical
          and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family
          Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central
          America and Mexico but four are native to the United States. </p>

          opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins
          are slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters.</p>
