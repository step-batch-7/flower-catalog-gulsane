        <p><strong>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</strong
          >is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive family,
          Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
          <strong> Abeliophyllum distichum</strong>Nakai, endemic to Korea,
          where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It
          is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow,
          flowers.</p>
          <p>It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are
          opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both
          above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the
          new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with
          a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm
          diameter. </p> 
          <p>It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.</p>
